Sprint 1 Report

Project Name: InsightAI – An Artificial Intelligence System Providing Access to Micro-Courses from Current Events
Sprint Duration: June 20, 2025 - July 6, 2025
Sprint Team: Furkan ÖZTÜRK, Enes KIRAÇ, Fatih Emre ERTEKİN, Kübra ÖZCAN, Emine ÇAKAR

⸻

1. Sprint Planning and Implementation Strategy

1.1. User Story and Backlog Management

Before the sprint, the fundamental requirements for the initial version of the system were defined in the Product Backlog. All user stories were integrated into the related backlog items with detailed descriptions. This allowed team members to easily access the scope and success criteria of each task throughout the sprint.

During the prioritization of backlog items, the main criteria were: establishing the system architecture, developing the first working prototype, and building the framework for the content flow to be presented to the user. To avoid accumulating technical debt during the sprint, tasks were carefully segmented.

1.2. Sprint Capacity and Story Point Estimation

Target points for Sprint 1: 100 points
The total backlog is structured as 300 points, divided into three equal sprints. Therefore, Sprint 1 was planned with a workload of 100 points.
The points were estimated based on task complexity, expected durations, and task dependencies. Individual estimation meetings were held for each task, and the points were finalized with the participation of all team members.

1.3. Task Distribution and Backlog Structure

The tasks selected for this sprint were determined to form the core building blocks of the project. These tasks include:
	•	Training the initial version of the AI model and testing its basic functions
	•	API integration for data retrieval from RSS and news sources on current events
	•	Defining micro-course content templates and creating a prototype
	•	Designing email templates and producing the first draft designs
	•	Researching and preparing for the integration of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) module

On the Sprint Board, tasks were tagged according to different categories:
	•	Pink: Artificial intelligence and software development tasks
	•	Purple: Tasks related to voice generation and processing
	•	Light Green: Tasks related to visual content production and media processing
	•	Dark Green: General technical tasks that do not fit into a specific category
	•	Blue: Interface design and user experience tasks

The last days of the sprint were intentionally left free to allow team members to rest and conduct retrospective evaluations.

⸻

2. Daily Monitoring and Communication Structure

2.1. Daily Scrum Meetings

Daily Scrum meetings were held every morning via Google Meet. In these meetings, each team member answered the following three key questions:
	1.	What did I do yesterday?
	2.	What do I plan to do today?
	3.	What obstacles am I facing?

The meeting notes and daily written communications were archived on Google Drive for documentation purposes. Additionally, team members maintained short status updates via WhatsApp and provided quick solutions to urgent issues.

⸻

3. Product Status and Prototype Development

At the end of the sprint, the first working version of the product was successfully achieved. The artificial intelligence module successfully demonstrated the ability to summarize a given news article and transform it into a short educational module.

Additionally, the following outputs were successfully completed:
	•	The core structure of the classifier algorithm analyzing current events
	•	Automated creation of datasets that can be transformed into educational modules
	•	Preparation of the first prototype newsletter draft
	•	Definition of the micro-course presentation structure to be displayed in the user interface

All these outputs enabled functional validation of the product and were tested within the team.

⸻

4. Sprint Review

During the Sprint Review meeting, each team member provided feedback on the completed tasks and the resulting product outputs. It was noted that the current system design is functional and capable of delivering meaningful and concise content to users.

The following feedback was received during the discussions:
	•	The text richness and topic diversity of the micro-course module can be improved
	•	Newsletter templates can be made simpler
	•	The system can support different media formats (video, audio) in future phases

The entire team agreed on the potential of the system and shared new ideas for future development.

Sprint Review Participants:
Furkan ÖZTÜRK, Enes KIRAÇ, Fatih Emre ERTEKİN, Kübra ÖZCAN, Emine ÇAKAR

⸻

5. Sprint Retrospective

During the sprint retrospective, the team evaluated both the production process and communication methods. The following decisions were made:
	•	The team was divided into two groups for more efficient workload management:
	•	Group 1 (Furkan, Enes, Fatih): Will continue working on system development and new modules
	•	Group 2 (Emine, Kübra): Will focus on testing existing modules, implementing feedback, and making the system user-ready
	•	Meetings will be scheduled at fixed weekly time slots.
	•	Requirement lists were prepared for potential data sources, educational modules, and visual/audio materials to be used in future sprints.

⸻

This sprint has been highly productive in shaping the core system architecture and successfully creating the prototype concept. The team has demonstrated a systematic approach to identifying and solving structural issues before moving on to advanced stages.

5. Sprint Retrospective
The team agreed to maintain the two-group structure established in Sprint 1. Responsibilities were reaffirmed as follows:

Group 1 (Furkan, Fatih): Planning new content modules and expanding the micro course framework

Group 2 (Enes, Kübra, Emine): Testing existing modules, synchronizing audio content, and finalizing user interfaces

It was decided that Group 2 would increase the frequency of internal meetings and adopt a tighter feedback loop for content production.

Additionally, preparatory work began for the following Sprint 3 objectives:

Advanced content filtering

Event-driven content recommendation

Mobile compatibility testing

This sprint marked a major transition in the user-facing components of the InsightAI project. The AI architecture became more responsive, the speech module more fluent, and the visual system clearer and more structured. Collectively, these advances significantly contributed to the system’s maturity and overall functionality.

The micro-course creation feature in our product is not yet fully completed, while the AI-powered newsletter generation functionality is demonstrated in the images below.
